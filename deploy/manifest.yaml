                                      MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                      be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the

                                          for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                          pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                          The same key is forbidden to exist in both matchLabelKeys and labelSelector.

                                Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%).
                                This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0.
                                Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up.
                                Defaults to 25%.
                                Example: when this is set to 30%, the new ReplicaSet can be scaled up immediately when
                                the rolling update starts, such that the total number of old and new pods do not exceed
                                130% of desired pods. Once old pods have been killed,
                                new ReplicaSet can be scaled up further, ensuring that total number of pods running
                                at any time during the update is at most 130% of desired pods.

                                          pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                          The same key is forbidden to exist in both matchLabelKeys and labelSelector.

                                Example: when this is set to 30%, the old ReplicaSet can be scaled down to 70% of desired pods
                                immediately when the rolling update starts. Once new pods are ready, old ReplicaSet
                                can be scaled down further, followed by scaling up the new ReplicaSet, ensuring
                                that the total number of pods available at all times during the update is at
                                least 70% of desired pods.

                              Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can

                              it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                              negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                                              pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.

                                        immediately when the rolling update starts. Once new pods are ready, old ReplicaSet
                                        can be scaled down further, followed by scaling up the new ReplicaSet, ensuring
                                        that the total number of pods available at all times during the update is at
                                        least 70% of desired pods.

                                              incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                              to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                              for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                              pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                              The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                              Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.
                                              This is a beta field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate (enabled by default).

                                      Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                                      tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                                      TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
                                      of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                                      it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                                      negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                                      Value is the taint value the toleration matches to.
                                      If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.

                                              be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                              incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key in (value)`
                                              to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                              for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                              pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                              The same key is forbidden to exist in both matchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                              Also, matchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.
                                              This is a beta field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate (enabled by default).

                                                  be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                                  incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                                  to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                                  for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                                  pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                                  The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                                  Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.
                                                  This is a beta field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate (enabled by default).

                                                        Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

                                        Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%).

                                      MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                      be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                      incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                      to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                      for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                      pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                      The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                      Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.
                                      This is a beta field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate (enabled by default).

                              Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                              Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                              Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                              tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                              TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
                              of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                              it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                              negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                                          MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                          be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                          incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                          to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                          for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                          pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                          The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                          Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.
                                          This is a beta field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate (enabled by default).

                                      MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                      be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                      incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                      to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                      for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                      pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                      The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                      Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.
                                      This is a beta field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate (enabled by default).

                                          be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                          incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                          to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                          for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                          pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                          The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                          Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.
                                          This is a beta field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate (enabled by default).

                                Example: when this is set to 30%, the new ReplicaSet can be scaled up immediately when
                                the rolling update starts, such that the total number of old and new pods do not exceed
                                130% of desired pods. Once old pods have been killed,
