                                the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http
                                and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future.
                                Incoming requests are matched against the host before
                                the IngressRuleValue. If the host is unspecified,
                                the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified
                                IngressRuleValue. \n host can be \"precise\" which
                                is a domain name without the terminating dot of a
                                network host (e.g. \"foo.bar.com\") or \"wildcard\",
                                which is a domain name prefixed with a single wildcard
                                label (e.g. \"*.foo.com\"). The wildcard character
                                '*' must appear by itself as the first DNS label and
                                matches only a single label. You cannot have a wildcard
                                label by itself (e.g. Host == \"*\"). Requests will
                                be matched against the Host field in the following
                                way: 1. If host is precise, the request matches this
                                rule if the http host header is equal to Host. 2.
                                If host is a wildcard, then the request matches this
                                rule if the http host header is to equal to the suffix
                                (removing the first label) of the wildcard rule."
